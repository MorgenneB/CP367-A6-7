Git tree:

* 2c7bdb5 (origin/master) Properly merged branches of Q1
* fc43c88 (origin/branch-1) 1b - inode update
* fa116b2 Functional Question 1a
* 577b411 Initialized question 1
* 218a1ae Initialized repository

Reflection:

When we merged the i-node update branch with the master branch, the i-node 
branch overwrote what was done in the master branch without warning.
We had to go back into the file after the merge to re-add the ls -l line.
